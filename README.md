## Objective 🎯

The primary aim of this project is to develop and deploy an end-to-end machine learning and deep learning solution to forecast **Rossmann Pharmaceuticals' store sales** up to **six weeks in advance**. This will help the team optimize resource allocation, plan for promotions, and adjust to changing market conditions. 

Key objectives include:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze customer purchasing behavior based on promotions, holidays, competition, and seasonality.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Build a sales prediction model using **scikit-learn pipelines** (starting with **Random Forest Regressor**).
- **Deep Learning Model**: Develop an **LSTM** model for time-series sales forecasting.
- **Prediction API**: Serve predictions through a **REST API** for real-time forecasting.

## Methodology 🛠️

### Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior 🔍

The first part of the project focuses on understanding **customer behavior** by exploring several influencing factors like **promotions**, **holidays**, **competition**, and **seasonality**.

Key questions answered:

- How do **promotions** affect sales and customer purchasing behavior? 💥
- What is the impact of **holidays** on sales? 🎉
- How does the **distance to competitors** influence store sales? 🏙️
- Are there **seasonal trends** in customer behavior? 🌦️

### Prediction of Store Sales 🔮

This phase involves building a robust **sales forecasting** model that incorporates data preprocessing, machine learning, and deep learning.

- **Preprocessing**: Handle missing data, outliers, and create new features (e.g., date-based features). 🔧
- **Model Building**: 
  - Train **Random Forest Regressor** as a baseline model using **scikit-learn** pipelines. 🤖
  - Develop a **two-layer LSTM** model for time-series forecasting. 📊
- **Loss Function**: Select the optimal loss function to minimize error and maximize prediction accuracy. 🔍
- **Post-Prediction Analysis**: Analyze feature importance and calculate confidence intervals for predictions. 📉
- **Serialization**: Save trained models with timestamps for tracking and version control. ⏳

### Model Serving API 🌐

The goal is to serve the machine learning and deep learning models via a **REST API** for **real-time sales predictions**.

Key steps:

- Develop a **REST API** using **Flask** or **FastAPI** to handle prediction requests. 🚀
- Load and serve serialized models from the training phase. 💾
- Deploy the API for live use, making predictions accessible to stakeholders. 🌍
