# Sales Forecasting and Customer Behavior Analysis for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning 📊🤖

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting future sales for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals' stores using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project aims to deliver actionable sales forecasts, allowing the finance team to plan and allocate resources efficiently. The solution includes detailed exploratory data analysis, machine learning modeling, deep learning with LSTM for time series prediction, and serving the predictions through a web API. 💡

### Business Need (Motivation)
At Rossmann Pharmaceuticals, store managers rely on personal judgment and years of experience to forecast sales, which may lead to inaccurate or inconsistent projections. The finance team needs a robust and scalable solution to predict sales for all stores across various cities six weeks ahead of time. The ability to forecast sales accurately will support better resource allocation and decision-making based on factors such as promotions, holidays, and competition. 📅💼

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build and deploy an end-to-end machine learning and deep learning solution for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals to forecast store sales up to six weeks in advance. Key objectives include:

- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer purchasing behavior. 📊
- Developing an optimized predictive model using machine learning and deep learning techniques. 🧠
- Improving decision-making for the finance team, allowing them to optimize resource allocation. 💰
- Serving predictions through a web-based API for real-time access. 🌐
- Offering insights into customer behavior based on factors such as promotions, holidays, and competition. 🎉📈
