Sales Forecasting and Customer Behavior Analysis for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning 📊💡
Overview 🌟
This project aims to leverage advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict future sales for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals. By using time-series forecasting and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project will empower the finance team to make data-driven decisions, optimize resource allocation, and streamline planning. The solution includes both traditional machine learning models and deep learning approaches using LSTM to predict sales with high accuracy, along with API deployment for real-time access to sales forecasts.

Objective 🎯
The primary goal of this project is to build and deploy an end-to-end sales forecasting solution for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals. This solution will predict sales up to six weeks in advance, considering key factors such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and store location. The key objectives include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer purchasing behavior.
Building a machine learning model for sales prediction using scikit-learn pipelines.
Deep learning with LSTM for accurate time-series forecasting.
Deployment of predictions through a web-based API for real-time access by business stakeholders.
Methodology 🛠️
Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior 🔍
Goal: Analyze customer behavior based on various influencing factors like promotions, holidays, and competition.

Key Questions Answered:

How do promotions impact sales and customer behavior? 🛍️
What is the effect of holidays on sales? 🎉
How does the distance to competitors affect store sales? 🏪
Are there observable seasonal trends in purchasing behavior? 🌦️
Prediction of Store Sales 📈
Preprocessing: Addressing missing data, handling outliers, and feature engineering (e.g., creating date-based features).
Model Building: Implementing machine learning models (initially Random Forest Regressor) using scikit-learn pipelines.
Loss Function: Choosing an appropriate loss function and evaluating model performance.
Post-Prediction Analysis: Evaluating feature importance and estimating confidence intervals for the predictions.
Serialization: Saving trained models with timestamps for version control and future tracking.
Deep Learning Model: Constructing an LSTM model for time-series forecasting, focusing on capturing temporal dependencies.
Model Serving API 🚀
Objective: Deploy machine learning and deep learning models through a REST API for real-time sales forecasting.

Key Steps:

Building the API: Using Flask or FastAPI to serve prediction requests.
Model Deployment: Loading and serving the serialized models from the prediction task.
Live Deployment: Ensuring the API is accessible for live use within the business for real-time forecasting.
Conclusion 🏁
This project provides a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for sales forecasting and customer behavior analysis. By integrating both machine learning and deep learning, Rossmann Pharmaceuticals can make data-driven decisions, optimize store operations, and better allocate resources. The API deployment ensures that the finance team and other stakeholders have real-time access to the forecasts, enabling them to plan effectively for the future.
